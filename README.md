NTS (also known as NTS Radio or NTS Live) is an online radio station and media platform based in the Hackney area of London, England. The station was founded in April 2011 by Femi Adeyemi and produces a diverse range of live radio shows, digital media and live music based events. Its tag line is 'Don't Assume'. The name NTS is an abbreviation for 'Nuts To Soup', which was the name of a previous blog run by Adeyemi. NTS has live stations in London, Manchester, Los Angeles and Shanghai and it broadcasts content live from over 30 cities a month. According to the Institute of Contemporary Arts, "NTS Radio is a family of like-minded and passionate individuals, dedicated to supporting exciting music and culture through online radio and events. NTS uncovers the best of the musical past, celebrates the present and cultivates the future of the underground music scene, and prides itself on being open-minded and experimental". In 2015, the Guardian reported that NTS has around 250,000 regular monthly listeners and described the radio as "somewhere between BBC 6 Music’s diversity and pirate radio’s DIY spirit". The radio station has collaborated with a number of brands, including Adidas, Carhartt, Johnnie Walker and Uniqlo. In collaboration with Uniqlo, NTS selects DJs to play once a month at the Tate Modern after regular opening hours.
